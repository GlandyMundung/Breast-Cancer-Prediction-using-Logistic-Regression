# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
In the breast cancer dataset, each datapoint has measurements from an image of a breast mass and whether or not itâ€™s cancerous. 
The goal will be to use these measurements to predict if the mass is cancerous or not.  
This dataset is built right into scikit-learn so no need to read in a csv. 
<b>The accuracy score is 96%<b>
